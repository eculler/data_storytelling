# Data Storytelling Project Final Submission

Over the course of this semester, you will have worked with a scientist, or team of scientists, to create an online data story based on their research. Your story should:
  * Faithfully represent the conclusions of the researchers
  * Use elements of rhetoric, creative nonfiction, and data visualization to appeal to a non-scientific audience of your choice
  * Incorporate at least one storytelling medium beyond text and images, such as audio, video, interactive data visualization, or virtual reality
  * Be accompanied by your (approximately) 1000-word reflection, which should:
    1. introduce your audience,
    2. explain how you hope your audience will change their perspective or opinion because of your data story
    3. select at least 3 elements of your data story and explain why they are designed to effectively engage or persuade your audience

## How to turn in your final data story

You will need to submit:
  * A link to your online data story
  * A link to your reflection

You can submit both of these in the link to the "Final Project Submission Form" in the [Important information]() section of the syllabus. 

## Evaluation

```warning
The technical features of your data story itself will **not** be a major component of your grade.
```

For the final project, you will be evaluated primarily on:

  * Your process throughout the semester
  * The design of your data story
  * Your reflection
  * An evaluation by the scientist(s) you are working with as to whether or not they feel their work is well-represented
  * Completing substantive peer reviews

If there are parts of your website that do not work as you were hoping, you can add a section to your reflection that explains what you were aiming for
