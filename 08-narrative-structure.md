# Narrative structure

This week we will discuss several types of narrative structures, including:
  * the hero's journey
  * 3- or 5-act dramatic arc
  * braided or spiral narratives

You will then decide what type of narrative structure you plan to use for your data story, and create an outline that reflects your chosen structure.
