# Data Storytelling Project Final Submission

Over the course of this semester, you will have worked with a scientist, or team of scientists, to create an online data story based on their research. Your story should:
  * **Faithfully** represent the conclusions of the researchers
  * Use elements of rhetoric, creative nonfiction, and data visualization to appeal to a **non-scientific audience** of your choice
  * Incorporate at least one **storytelling medium** beyond text and images, such as audio, video, interactive data visualization, or virtual reality
  * Be accompanied by your reflection, which should:
    1. introduce your **audience**,
    2. explain how you hope your audience will **change their perspective or opinion** because of your data story
    3. select at least 3 elements of your data story and explain why they are designed to effectively **engage or persuade your audience**
    4. cite at least 5 sources we covered this semester, or others you have found, supporting your storytelling approach

## How to turn in your final data story

You will need to submit:
  * A link to your online data story
  * A link to your (approximately) 1000-word reflection

You can submit both links to the "Final Project Submission Form" in the [Important information]() section of the syllabus. In addition, you will need to:

  * Completed peer review forms for all the other students in your section.

The peer review form can also be found in the [Important information]() section of the syllabus.

## Evaluation

```warning
The technical features of your data story will **not** be a major component of your grade. If there are parts of your website that do not work as you were hoping, you can add an (approximately) 500-word section to your reflection that explains your goals and next steps.
```

For the final project, you will be evaluated primarily on:

  * Your process throughout the semester
  * The design of your data story
  * Your reflection
  * An evaluation by the scientist(s) you are working with, which will ask whether or not they feel their work is well-represented
  * Completing substantive peer reviews
