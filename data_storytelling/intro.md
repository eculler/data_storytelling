# Welcome to Data Storytelling

Data Storytelling is a class and, I hope, a community for folks practicing the craft of telling compelling data-based stories.

## What makes a data story?

In science, we typically present data as:

  1. A graph, such as a line plot or histogram
  2. A caption that describes the plot
  3. A conclusion that interprets the plot

We'll get into different ideas about what a story is in more depth. However, in contrast to the typical scientific paper, a story is about **characters** who change over **time** in response to some kind of **conflict or tension**. This kind of structure taps into emotions, drawing attention and investment in a deeper and more fundamental way than most scientific papers.

In fact, I would argue that scientific papers are specifically designed to *remove* any elements of story. There are some good reasons to do this in particular situations. In particular, as scientists we don't want to get *so* caught up in a story that we are ignoring or misinterpreting evidence. But in other situations, for example where action is called for, or we want to include a broader audience, storytelling can be a valuable tool.

## Who is Data Storytelling for?

Data storytelling is an interdisciplinary field. This class is for:
  * Scientists looking to improve communication skills
  * Journalists who want to report on big data and AI topics
  * Artists who want to use data in their work
  * Web developers interested in creating engaging, interactive sites about science
  * Anyone working towards a degree in any of the above

If you don't have any background in coding or statistics (at the level of one introductory course), I'd recommend you start there and come back to Data Storytelling later on.

## What will you learn?

This class is intended to introduce you to many fundamental skills for effective science narratives. 

### Science communication

Fundamental principles of effective science communication when it comes to both visualization and writing:

  * Headlines and other lessons from journalism
  * Messaging
  * Principles of data visualization:
    * Grammar of graphics
    * Matching the visualization to the message
    * Color theory
    * Annotation

### Narrative creative non-fiction

Using elements of creative writing for more effective storytelling:

  * Plot structures
  * Point of view
  * Description
  * Metaphor

### User experience design

  * Ideation
  * Storyboarding
  * Paper prototypes
  * Universal design/Accessibility

### Big data and AI
  
Though we won't be able to cover the skills you would need to develop complex AI models, you should be able to think critically about these types of analyses, including:

  * Strengths and weaknesses of AI models
  * Uncertainty in data science
  * Principles of dataset development for AI
  * Interpreting AI results in context

### Web development
  
  * Building and publishing web pages using GitHub
  * Markdown and other structured text
  * Bootstrap and themes
  * Adding interactive visualizations
  * Hosting options for multimedia files

## How will it work?

Each week, you will:
  * Meet in small-group recitation for a discussion of example data narratives
  * Complete a hands-on data storytelling assignment. Something will be due each week, but we will alternate between planning and execution. For example, you may submit sketches and an outline one week, followed by a web-page based on those notes.
  * Publish your work in an online portfolio using GitHub Pages

These projects can be based on your own data analysis if you have something prepared, but in general you will select and adapt existing scientific studies. There will be seven assignments in total:
  * A one-week introductory assignment in which you publish the home page of your online portfolio
  * Five two-week assignments, each focusing on one mode of science communication
  * A four-week final project

The technology of storytelling has expanded enormously with computers and the internet. You should expect to learn how to use a wide variety of technology in this class, but more importantly I'm hoping to help you develop your own process for learning new technology, and the flexibility to adapt to new tools. Technology is always a moving target. Where possible, we will try to use free and open-source technology so that you continue to have access to it going forward.

You will find a description of each project on its own page of this site:

## How and when to get help

It is more important to me that you know when and how to ask for help with technology than that you be able to complete every assignment on your own. If you are working on a technical problem for more than 30 minutes, please consider one of the following options:
  1. ChatGPT -- chat has a lot of information about technology, especially coding, and is usually pretty good at explaining it.
  2. Internet fora, like StackOverflow
  3. Discussion board -- ask your classmates (I'll be checking, too)
  4. Office hours. You may also set up an individual meeting if the office hour times don't work for you.

When asking for help, from whatever source, you should always include the following information:

  1. What were you trying to do/ what were you hoping would happen?
  2. What did you do? Include a minimal reproducible example that illustrates your problem.
  3. What actually happened? Include any relevant *complete* error messages and/or screenshots and screen captures
  4. What system were you working on? Include your operating system or cloud platform and what software you used.
