# Assignment 1: Publish your online portfolio

Use [these instructions](https://earthlab-education.github.io/Earth-Analytics-2023-01-Intro/create-portfolio-website/00-create-portfolio-website.html) to create and publish a portfolio website on GitHub.

You will post all your work on your portfolio throughout the semester. You can also choose to add other projects if you like. For now, your portfolio should have:

  * A brief bio
  * A photo
  * A theme

**Static** websites like your portfolio have three components:
  1. Content, written in some type of structured markup language like Markdown or Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML)
  2. Styling, controlling size, color, and layout, written in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
  3. Interactive components, written in Javascript

You may eventually want to write a website that has a more developed **back end**, allowing you to dynamically build webpages based on a database or perform calculations on your web server. You can't do either of those things with GitHub Pages, but you can still make an attractive and interactive webpage using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

A website I recommend finding a [free bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes) that you like, but you may also use one of the built-in GitHub Pages themes.
