# Audience, or Developing Personas

Before you begin designing your data story, you must know who you are designing it for. In class, we will explore the rhetorical concept of audience, and the related human-computer interaction design concept of personas.

```{note}
To complete this assignment, you should speak to at least one person who is a member of your audience, or who works extensively member of your audience.
```

## How to turn your audience assignment

For this week's assignment, submit:

1. A [Jamboard](https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/jamboard/) that defines your audience using words (your own, or quotes from interviews), pictures, your own drawings, videos, published literature about your audience, and/or examples of data stories geared at your audience.
2. A 3-5 minute video in which your present what you have learned about your audience, to be played in class for peer review

using the "Audience Submission Survey" on the [Important Information page of the syllabus]().

You also must complete the "Peer Review Survey" on the [Important Information page of the syllabus]() for each member of your section. You should take notes, or even complete the survey entirely, as you listen.

## Things to think about when developing your understanding of your audience

When exploring which audience you hope to reach, you should consider:

  * Age group and/or educational background
  * Identities and life experiences
  * Where will they encounter your story? On social media? In a newspaper? Literary journal? At a museum?
  * How will they engage with your story?
  * What do you expect them to already know about your topic?
  * Why is your topic important to them?
  * How would you go about reaching this audience?
  * What are your audiences *needs* as it pertains to science or your topic specifically?
  * What does your audience *value* as it pertains to science or your topic?

## Evaluation

```{warning}
You **will not** be evaluated on the graphic design of your Jamboard! In fact, at this stage your understanding of your audience is likely to change, and an immaculate Jamboard may make it hard for you to do that.
```

You will be evaluated by me and the other students in your section based on the following rubric.
