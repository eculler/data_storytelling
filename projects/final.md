# Data Storytelling Project Final Submission

Over the course of this semester, you will have worked with a scientist, or team of scientists, to create an online data story based on their research. Your story should:
  * **Faithfully** represent the conclusions of the researchers
  * Use elements of rhetoric, creative nonfiction, and data visualization to appeal to a **non-scientific audience** of your choice
  * Incorporate at least one **storytelling medium** beyond text and images, such as audio, video, interactive data visualization, or virtual reality
  * Be accompanied by your reflection, which should:
    1. introduce your **audience**,
    2. explain how you hope your audience will **change their perspective or opinion** because of your data story
    3. select at least 3 elements of your data story and explain why they are designed to effectively **engage or persuade your audience**
    4. cite at least 5 sources we covered this semester, or others you have found, supporting your storytelling approach

## How to turn in your final data story

You will need to submit:
  * A link to your online data story
  * A link to your (approximately) 1000-word reflection

You can submit both links to the "Final Project Submission Form" in the [Important information]() section of the syllabus. In addition, you will need to:

  * Completed peer review forms for all the other students in your section.

The peer review form can also be found in the [Important information]() section of the syllabus.

## Evaluation

```{warning}
The technical features of your data story will **not** be a major component of your grade. If there are parts of your website that do not work as you were hoping, you can add an (approximately) 500-word section to your reflection that explains your goals and next steps.
```

For the final project, you will be evaluated primarily on:

  * Your process throughout the semester
  * An evaluation by the scientist(s) you are working with, which will ask whether or not they feel their work is well-represented
  * The design of your data story, as represented by your reflection
  * Completing substantive peer reviews

```{note}
You will be graded on process throughout the semester. You can resubmit any of your process reviews at this point, if you do not think your original submission fully represents the work you have done.
```
